# FullStack Social Media App

### Explanation of the App:

Create a user, upload photos, CRUD posts, see posts of other users,
add new friends, see other users and their information,
change Light mode to Dark mode, the app is Responsive.

To register and login I used JWT, Redux persist to store in local storage,
React drop zone for image uploads, Multer for file upload. The data is
from back-end API that I created with MongoDB. For runtime I used
NodeJS, ExpressJS for the framework, Mongoose for managing the
MongoDB, For the framework I used React, React router for
navigation, Formik and Yup for form and form navigation,
ReduxToolkit for the state management.
